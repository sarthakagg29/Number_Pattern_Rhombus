# Number_Pattern_Rhombus
A code that will print a series of numbers such that it will look like a rhombus.

## Starting 
User will input the number and code will print a Rhombus only with boundries shown by numbers. That numbers will be having a logical pattern and user will get a rhombus of inputted number Rows.

## Logical Pattern of Numbers
The number inputted will be going through a mirror algorithm in which the number will be divided into two.The first range of numbers till the middle part, the values will be printed in an increasing manner with an addition of 1 and after the counter has reached the middle row or middle value (the halved of inputted value), the numbers will be decreasing with a subtraction of 1

### Here is an example
- Input Value :  10

```
          0  
        1   1  
      2       2  
    3           3  
  4               4  
5                   5  
  4               4  
    3           3  
      2       2  
        1   1
 ```
